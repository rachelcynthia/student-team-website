            <h2 id="GeneralIntroduction">General Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Thank for you showing interest in joining the Library Student Team!
                <br />
                This page will give an overview of our approach to recruitment with a breakdown of each stage, including
                after you accept your offer to join the team.
            </p>
            <h2 id="Stage1">STAGE 1: Advertisement</h2>
            <p>
                Positions for the Library Student Team will be advertised on CareerConnect for roughly 2-3 weeks at a
                time, we will also post alerts on our social media - make sure to keep your CareerConnect notifications
                on and follow our Instagram @UoMLibrary to keep an eye out for openings!
                <br />
                The advert will include general information about the team, what we do, and logistics such as pay rate
                and hours, as well as how to apply. It will also include key contact details for support, advice for
                completing application forms and preparing for group interviews, and information regarding our status as
                an equal opportunities employer.
            </p>
            <h2 id="Stage2">STAGE 2: Application</h2>
            <p>
                You will be asked to complete our application form before the advertised deadline. This will typically
                include answering 3-5 questions with 150 word or less answers aimed at evidencing your skills and
                experience relevant to the role. Whilst the questions are subject to change between each round, they
                will usually look at skills such as collaboration, time management, customer service, and digital
                capabilities. These applications are then compiled and reviewed against our listed requirements.
                <br />
                In the event you are unsuccessful, all applicants will be notified with general guidance on improving
                your written application for next time but unfortunately, due to the volume of applications, we cannot
                provided personalised feedback at this stage.
                <br />
                In the event you are successful, you will receive an invite to interview via email. This will include
                key information about how the interview will run, photos of the location, advice and suggested reading
                around our team and what we do.
            </p>
            <h2 id="Stage3">STAGE 3: Group Interview</h2>
            <p>

                We like to think our interview stage is not your standard interview - we understand the term â€˜Group
                Interview' can be intimidating at first! Please refer to your invite to interview for specific
                information, as this is also subject to change between recruitment rounds.
                <br />
                The room will be set up for group activities, facilitated by a member of the Library Team and at least
                two current Student Team Members. These activities are an opportunity for us to get to know you, you to
                get to know us, and to showcase your collaborative skills and your passions - there are no wrong
                answers. This is where you decide if we are the right fit for you, as much as we decide if you are the
                right fit for the team. Again, the activities may be subject to change between rounds, however they have
                historically included:
                <br />
                A 1-to-1 Q&A-style activity for us to provide an overview of the role, discuss your own interests, and
                for you to ask questions and learn about current ST member's experiences.
                <br />
                A Peer to Peer Support activity with an example enquiry we may get from a student to showcase your
                interpersonal and problem-solving skills.
                <br />
                A Student Voice activity with an example scenario aimed at gathering student perspectives and
                representing different experiences, especially underrepresented groups.
                <br />
                In the event you are unsuccessful, you will be notified with direct feedback - it is a competitive
                process, and we understand it can be stressful waiting around, so we aim to do this ASAP.
                <br />
                In the event you are successful, congratulations! You will be notified with all relevant information
                and, if you choose to accept the offer, you are now a member of the Library Student Team!

            </p>
            <h2 id="Stage4">STAGE 4: Induction</h2>
            <p>
                Once you have accepted your offer, you will be invited to book your first shift which will be a general
                induction session. You will be introduced to the relevant Teaching, Learning and Students Staff, as well
                as the current TLS Interns and any ST members also on shift. You will receive our Handbook and Code of
                Conduct to explain expectations of the role, as well as familiarised with the digital systems we use for
                communications and organisation. We provide essential training such as fire safety, GDPR, and widening
                participation. We also recommend shadowing other ST members on their daily tasks, especially running our
                academic skills workshops both online and on-campus.
            </p>
            <h2 id="Stage5">STAGE 5: Reflection and Feedback</h2>
            <p>
                Student voice and experience are the backbone of the Library Student Team, so it is important to us that
                ST members have the opportunity to get involved with and develop the recruitment process for future
                applicants. You will be asked to provide your own reflection and feedback on how you found the
                recruitment process so we can continue to improve going forward, we encourage you to be as open and
                honest as possible. We always value student feedback and this is a value we carry throughout your entire
                time with us on the Library Student Team.
            </p>

                <b>Q: Where can I find current ST members on campus? </b>
                <br />
                A: We are based in the Main Library, and we can be identified by our bright red branded t-shirts. You
                will usually find us in the academic skills workshops, both in the Main Library and Alan Gilbert
                Learning Commons. We are also frequently found all around campus at different events, such as Open Days
                and Freshers Fairs. Feel free to have a chat with any of our friendly team members and we'll answer your
                questions as best we can!

                <br />
                A: Once you are inducted onto the team, we do offer the opportunity to apply for one of our Area Lead
                roles. This allows you to specialise in a specific work area that interests you the most, taking the
                lead on project development. Each area will have 2 area leads, giving you someone to collaborate and
                bounce ideas off of, along with support from the wider TLS staff. Of course, you can also still get
                involved with all of the other projects going on, you are not restricted by this role at all. Areas
                change every now and then but frequently include topics such as academic material development,
                accessibility, access and success programmes, social media, library campaigns, environmental
                responsibility, data and feedback etc.

                <br />
                A: Yes! This paid role will count towards the Step up and Lead requirement for Undergraduates and the

                further details about how to achieve your Stellify Award before graduating.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Q: What opportunities and qualifications can this role offer me? </b>
                <br />
                A: We prioritise the professional and personal development of our members during their time on the team.
                You will have plenty of opportunities to develop your leadership skills, network with professionals both

                information about the team's achievements through our awards section.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Q: Are the working hours flexible? </b>
                <br />
                A: Yes. We understand that you are busy students and encourage you to always prioritise your studies, so
                you book your own shifts according to your timetable. You will be expected to maintain a consistent
                level of commitment to the role, which will average 8 hours per week, with more flexibility around
                assessment period and term holidays.
