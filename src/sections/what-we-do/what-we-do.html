    <!-- <h2>Welcome to the Digital Exam Toolkit</h2> -->
    <p> The University of Manchester Library Student Team (UMLST) was founded in 2013, initially to provide roving
        support around library sites but has grown into a powerful case of student-staff collaboration and pioneering
        student partnership at a sector-wide level. We provide study support across the 3 Teaching, Learning and
        Students (TLS) Programmes, ensure students feel welcome when attending TLS workshops/drop-ins, and are leaders
        in challenging and enhancing Library and University-wide pedagogies, practices and services.</p>

We create educational content that is accessible and actively reflect on their lived experiences which make their way into the university's central skills support service - My Learning Essentials (MLE). Subsequently, they also support the sister programmes to MLE - My Research Essential (MRE) and Specialist Library Support (SLS). This is the first image.">
