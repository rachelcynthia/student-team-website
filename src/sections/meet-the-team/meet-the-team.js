I\'ve been a part of the Library Student Team for three months now, and it has been an incredible experience from day one. Working with such a diverse team has allowed me to learn so much from my colleagues, things I had never learnt before. Engaging with people from different backgrounds, degrees, and personalities has been truly interesting. I especially enjoy meeting new people during our daily workshops and events. \nOutside of my role in the library, I have a few hobbies that keep me busy. I love listening to music, especially K-Pop, and I enjoy trying out new recipes (since I\'m an international student so I need to survive in the UK by myself ðŸ˜Š). I\'m also passionate about traveling and discovering new cultures and cuisines (although i have not done much traveling since coming to the UK, as I usually go back home only during the summer).\nIf you ever need any help, feel free to reach out, I\'m always happy to chat!'

I love music, reading, environmental and sustainability work, knitting, films, cooking and Yoga (qualified to teach too). Oh, and I love dachshunds too! I\'m a member of the UoM Pole and Burlesque society which has been one of the most empowering experiences during my time at the University.

When I\'m not deep into engineering work, you\'ll find me jamming on my guitar. Earlier last year, I went all-out adventurer and took an 18-day solo trip â€” definitely one of my most epic experiences. I also go through intense reading phases where I finish a book in a week, only to get stuck on the same page of another for a month :)'
