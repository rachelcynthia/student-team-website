                        Staff,
                        as well
                        as the current TLS Interns and any ST members also on shift. You will receive our Handbook
                        and
                        Code of
                        Conduct to explain expectations of the role, as well as familiarised with the digital
                        systems we
                        use for
                        communications and organisation. We provide essential training such as fire safety, GDPR,
                        and
                        widening
                        participation. We also recommend shadowing other ST members on their daily tasks, especially
                        running our
                        academic skills workshops both online and on-campus.</p>

                        Team, so it is important to us that
                        ST members have the opportunity to get involved with and develop the recruitment process for
                        future
                        applicants. You will be asked to provide your own reflection and feedback on how you found
                        the
                        recruitment process so we can continue to improve going forward, we encourage you to be as
                        open
                        and
                        honest as possible. We always value student feedback and this is a value we carry throughout
                        your entire
                        time with us on the Library Student Team.</p>
